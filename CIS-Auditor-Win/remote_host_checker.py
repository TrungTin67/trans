'''
This is the entry point of the script. The function reads from a configuration file specified
by the user when running the script, checks the remote host requirements for each host specified 
in the configuration file, and writes the results to "remote_test_result.txt".

The configuration file is specified via a command-line argument --config when running the script.
Each row of the configuration file should contain information for a single host.

The function iterates through each host, checks the remote host requirements using the 
check_connection function, and records the results. If all requirements are met for a host, 
the function prints and records a success message. If not, it prints and records the error message.

At the end of the script, the function writes all the results to "remote_test_result.txt" in the 
same directory where the script is located.

Usage: 
    python remote_host_checker.py --config /path/to/config/file

:param --config: A string containing the path to the configuration file.
